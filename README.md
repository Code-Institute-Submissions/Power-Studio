#  **POWER STUDIO** 
As part of the Diploma in Software Development run by Code Institute that I am completing with UCD Professional Acadamey, I must complete five portfolio projects. This is the first portfolio project and the focus of this project is to show my ability to use HTML and CSS.

# User Experience (UX)

User Stories:

* As a user, I would like to be able to easily navigate through the webpage.
* As a user, I would like to see motivating imagery to join the studio.
* As a user, I would like to be able to see what classes are on and when.
* As a user, I would like to be able to easily contact the owners for more information.
* As a user, I would like to know where the studio is located.
* As a user, I would like to know the qualifications of the team that run the studio.
* As a user, I would like to know other peoples' experience of the studio.
* As a user, I would like to know what my payment options are.
* As a user, I would like to easily find the information I am looking for.
* As a user, I would like to find their social pages.

# **Design**

**Colours**:

The three main colours I used are:
* ![#11151c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/11151c/000000?text=+) `#11151c`
* ![#efaac4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/efaac4/000000?text=+) `#efaac4`
* ![#602f5e](https://via.placeholder.com/15/602f5e/000000?text=+) `#602f5e`

I used these colours as they are easy to read together, are feminine for a women's studio and are eye catching.

**Typography**


**Structure**

The site will consist of 6 main pages; Home, About Us, Timetable, Memberships, Testimonials and Contact, Us.
