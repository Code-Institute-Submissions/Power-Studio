                    From the first moment that I walked into the studio I was amazed by the atmosphere. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. The trainers were really encouraging and helped to fix my form for classes without highlighting what I was doing wrong infront of the rest of the class. I trust these girls so much and absolutely love the energy and life that they bring to the class.

                    I have been going to the pole dancing classes in Power Studio for a few months now and it is my favourite class now. At first, I was really intimidated and didn't understand what the class would be like. After talking to the instructors and being assured that I can wear just shorts and a tank top, I decided to just try it. With the help of the instructors, I quickly gained confidence and started going to the mixed level classes. The other girls at these classes are so supportive and encouraging. I have recommended this class to almost everyone I know.

                    I wanted to join a womens fitness studio for awhile before I found Power Studio. Most of the studios I found while trying to find the best one for me were too feminine for what made me comfortable. I wanted to find a studio that not only had the safe space of being womens only, but also encouraged building muscle instead of just becoming lean. I compete in body-building competitions so I wanted to do classes that would challenge my body in alignment with what my fitness goals are. The instructors here really encourage the women who attend to choose what weights they feel comfortable with and help each girl to reach their fitness goals.
